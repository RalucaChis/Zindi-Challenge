# Zindi Challenge
Blood Spectroscopy Classification Challenge

Recently a new competition has started on the Zindi website and more details about it can be found here [zindi_challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/bloodsai-blood-spectroscopy-classification-challenge). The given problem is to classify three blood characteristics, LDL Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol and Haemoglobin, as 'high', 'low' or 'ok'. For this purpose I preprocessed the given data, applied a Random Forest Classifier, submitted my results on the Zindi website and obtained in the end an accuracy as high as 0.702.
